Hi there! I am Young-Min Cho (go by Jeffrey), a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, focusing on Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. As a member of [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/), [WWBP](https://wwbp.org/), and [CSL](https://csl-lab-upenn.github.io/), I am advised by [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and [Dr. Sharath Chandra Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/).   

My study focuses on Multi-Agent Systems and Conversational Agents, exploring how to achieve consensus in agent collaboration, control conversation behavior traits, and generate good clarifying questions. I am also working on deriving social and psychological insights from language-based assessments, such as mental health chatbots and cultural differences in emotional expressions.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University, where I studied under [Dr. Sunku Hahn](https://web.yonsei.ac.kr/sunkuhahn/index.htm) and [Dr. Taeyoung Park](https://dslab-with.github.io/web/). Additionally, I obtained a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by [Dr. Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/).
