Hi there! I am Young-Min Cho (go by Jeffrey), a first year Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, focusing on Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. As a member of [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/), [WWBP](https://wwbp.org/) and [CSL](https://csl-lab-upenn.github.io/), I am advised by [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and [Dr. Sharath Chandra Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/).   

I'm deeply intrigued by the potential of Large Language Models and am keen on discovering innovative methods to address challenges. Lately, my focus has been on conversational agents, exploring aspects like back-channeling, interruption, and multi-party discussions. Additionally, I have been engaged in computational social listening projects, examining social and psychological insights derived from social media data analysis.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University, where I studied under [Dr. Sunku Hahn](https://web.yonsei.ac.kr/sunkuhahn/index.htm) and [Dr. Taeyoung Park](https://dslab-with.github.io/web/). Additionally, I obtained a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by [Dr. Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/).
